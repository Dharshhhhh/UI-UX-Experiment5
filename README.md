## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a Mental Wellness Companion App and a Smart Waste Management App for urban areas.

## Algorithm:

### STEP 1: Understand the Scenario

Analyze the given UX design scenarios — Mental Wellness Companion App and Smart Waste Management App — to identify the target users, their needs, and overall goals for improving user experience.

### STEP 2: Identify User Pain Points

Observe or assume realistic challenges faced by users in each scenario.

For the wellness app, focus on stress management, emotional tracking, and motivation.

For the waste management app, focus on communication gaps, reporting issues, and service inefficiency.

### STEP 3: Write UX Problem Statements

Formulate problem statements using the UX template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."
Develop two clear problem statements for each scenario that highlight specific user difficulties.

### STEP 4: Select Research Methods

Identify suitable research methods to explore user needs and validate design solutions.
For example:

Mental Wellness App: User interviews, diary studies, usability testing.

Waste Management App: Surveys, field observation, contextual inquiry.

### STEP 5: Justify Method Selection

Explain the rationale for each method, showing how it helps gather meaningful insights about user behavior, emotional challenges, and environmental interactions.

### STEP 6: Create User Personas

Based on realistic assumptions or existing data, create at least two user personas per scenario.
Include:
Demographics (age, occupation, location)
Goals and motivations
Behaviors and habits
Pain points and frustrations
Quotes or statements representing user perspective

### STEP 7: Summarize Findings

Summarize how the identified pain points, problem statements, research methods, and personas connect to guide user-centered design decisions for both projects.
Highlight how the proposed solutions aim to improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

## Scenario 1: Government Service Portal – Applying for Community Certificate


A state government wants to redesign its online public service portal, where citizens apply for documents such as community certificates, income certificates, and birth certificates.
Currently, users struggle to locate the correct service, the forms often don’t load properly on mobile, and the portal provides almost no visibility into application status.

Citizens frequently abandon the online process and end up physically visiting government offices, which defeats the purpose of digital service delivery. The UX team is assigned to redesign the portal for clarity, accessibility, and transparency.

## Scenario 2: Online Learning Platform – Short Technical Courses

A rapidly growing ed-tech startup offers short courses (Python, UI/UX, Data Science).
However, learners complain that course pages are confusing, video lectures load inconsistently, and the platform does not show clear module progression.

Students often enroll in the wrong course because descriptions lack details like skill level, prerequisites, and learning outcomes.
Additionally, learners often drop out mid-course because they cannot track what they have completed and what’s left.

## Persona 1 - Aanya Patel

Occupation: School Teacher

Goals:

Apply for income certificate without visiting offices

Behaviors:

Works mostly on mobile

Reads instructions carefully

Pain Points:

Forms unclear

Portal crashes on mobile

Motivation:

Save time and avoid queues
## Persona 2 - Rohan Deshmukh

Age: 23

Occupation: College Student

Goals:

Get documents issued fast

Behaviors:

Fast digital habits

Hates long text

Pain Points:

Can’t find the right link

Status tracking unreliable

Motivation:

Complete tasks quickly and move on

## Scenario 2: Designing a Smart Waste Management App for Urban

1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

User Pain Points Identified:

● Residents don't know when garbage collection happens in their area.

● There's no easy way to report missed pickups or overflowing bins.

● Lack of real-time communication between municipal services and citizens leads to frustration.

1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points

Learners struggle to choose the right course because descriptions are vague.

They can’t track learning progress or revisit old modules easily.

Video content loads slowly and lacks structure.

Problem Statements

"An online learner needs a way to choose suitable courses because current course details lack clarity, which results in confusion and wrong enrollment choices."

"A student needs a way to track learning progress across modules because the platform does not provide a structured flow, which results in inconsistent learning habits."

Justification:

Surveys provide large-scale data on citizen experiences.

Field observation exposes operational inefficiencies.

Contextual inquiry gives first-hand understanding of on-ground challenges.



## Output:
### Government Service Portal – Applying for Community Certificate

## Result:

The UX problems, suitable research methods, and user personas for both scenarios were successfully identified and documented.
